This is a copy-and-paste clone of the react-scripts package.

This is necessary to fork since the upstream package has stopped updating its
dependencies and apparently is unmaintained now.

We have to clone via copy and paste rather than using a fork since the upstream
is a monorepo and I don't want to copy all that.
